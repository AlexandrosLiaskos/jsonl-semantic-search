{"title": "Introduction to Machine Learning", "content": "Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to learn from data, without being explicitly programmed. The name machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel. Machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data.", "tags": ["AI", "machine learning", "data science"], "date": "2023-01-15"}
{"title": "Deep Learning Fundamentals", "content": "Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised. Deep learning architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks, recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, audio recognition, social network filtering, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis, material inspection and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance.", "tags": ["AI", "deep learning", "neural networks"], "date": "2023-02-20"}
{"title": "Natural Language Processing", "content": "Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. The goal is a computer capable of understanding the contents of documents, including the contextual nuances of the language within them. The technology can then accurately extract information and insights contained in the documents as well as categorize and organize the documents themselves.", "tags": ["AI", "NLP", "computational linguistics"], "date": "2023-03-10"}
{"title": "Vector Embeddings Explained", "content": "Vector embeddings are a way to represent discrete variables like words as continuous vectors in a high-dimensional space. The goal is to capture semantic relationships between the variables in the geometric properties of the embedding space. For example, in word embeddings, words with similar meanings tend to be close to each other in the embedding space. Popular embedding techniques include Word2Vec, GloVe, and more recently, contextual embeddings from models like BERT and GPT. These embeddings are fundamental to many modern NLP tasks.", "tags": ["NLP", "embeddings", "vectors"], "date": "2023-04-05"}
{"title": "Introduction to TensorFlow", "content": "TensorFlow is an open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks. TensorFlow was developed by the Google Brain team for internal Google use before being released under the Apache License 2.0 in 2015. TensorFlow provides a Python API, as well as C++, Haskell, Java, Go, and Rust APIs.", "tags": ["TensorFlow", "machine learning", "programming"], "date": "2023-05-12"}
{"title": "The BM25 Algorithm", "content": "BM25 (Best Matching 25) is a ranking function used by search engines to estimate the relevance of documents to a given search query. It is based on the probabilistic retrieval framework and represents a significant improvement over the basic TF-IDF model. BM25 considers document length and term frequency saturation, making it more robust for real-world search applications. Despite being developed in the 1970s and 1980s, BM25 remains a strong baseline for many information retrieval tasks.", "tags": ["information retrieval", "search", "algorithms"], "date": "2023-06-18"}
{"title": "Hybrid Search Systems", "content": "Hybrid search systems combine multiple search techniques to improve overall search quality. A common approach is to combine keyword-based search (like BM25) with semantic search using vector embeddings. This allows the system to capture both lexical matches and semantic similarity. Hybrid systems often outperform single-technique approaches because they can handle a wider range of search intents and query types. Modern search engines and recommendation systems frequently use hybrid approaches to deliver the most relevant results.", "tags": ["search", "information retrieval", "hybrid systems"], "date": "2023-07-22"}
{"title": "Cosine Similarity in Vector Space", "content": "Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors in a multi-dimensional space. It's a judgment of orientation and not magnitude: two vectors with the same orientation have a cosine similarity of 1, while vectors at 90Â° have a similarity of 0. In the context of text analysis and search, cosine similarity is often used to compare document vectors, where each dimension corresponds to a term in the vocabulary. This metric is particularly useful for semantic search applications where the goal is to find documents with similar meaning regardless of exact keyword matches.", "tags": ["vectors", "similarity", "mathematics"], "date": "2023-08-30"}
{"title": "Query Expansion Techniques", "content": "Query expansion is the process of reformulating a seed query to improve retrieval performance in information retrieval operations. The goal is to reduce the mismatch between the query and document vocabularies by adding related terms to the original query. Common techniques include using synonyms from thesauri, analyzing co-occurrence statistics, leveraging word embeddings, or using pseudo-relevance feedback. Modern search systems often employ query expansion to improve recall without significantly sacrificing precision.", "tags": ["information retrieval", "search", "query processing"], "date": "2023-09-15"}
{"title": "Evaluating Search Quality", "content": "Evaluating search quality involves measuring how well a search system meets user needs. Common metrics include precision (fraction of retrieved documents that are relevant), recall (fraction of relevant documents that are retrieved), F1 score (harmonic mean of precision and recall), mean average precision (MAP), and normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG). Beyond these metrics, user satisfaction measures like click-through rate and time-to-click provide insights into real-world performance. A comprehensive evaluation strategy typically combines offline metrics with online user behavior analysis.", "tags": ["search", "evaluation", "metrics"], "date": "2023-10-20"}
